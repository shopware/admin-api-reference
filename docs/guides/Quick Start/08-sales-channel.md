# Sales Channel

The sales channels represent the interface from your administration to a storefront or frontend. You can create your own sales channel for each channel you want to use to sell your products. 
In addition to an online shop, it is also possible to connect a merchandise management system, which is directly linked to your local shop.

  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer Your_API_Key"
  }
}
```
