# Order Management

The order resource enables merchants to process orders they receive from customers.

You can use the orders resource to do the following:

* Retrieve orders and their line-items
* Create orders
* Update order statuses
* Manage returns

## Retrieve Orders

A list of all customer orders is obtained using the below route:

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "/api/search/order",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
  }
}
```

[Sorting](https://shopware.stoplight.io/docs/store-api/cf710bf73d0cd-search-queries#sort), [aggregating](https://shopware.stoplight.io/docs/store-api/cf710bf73d0cd-search-queries#aggregations) and [filtering](https://shopware.stoplight.io/docs/store-api/cf710bf73d0cd-search-queries#filter) order results is possible using a [search criteria](https://shopware.stoplight.io/docs/store-api/cf710bf73d0cd-search-queries).

### Order line-items

An order can have other items or child items of `type` - `product`, `promotion`, `credit` or `custom`. To fetch line items for a particular order, try the below route:

```json http
{
  "method": "get",
  "url": "http://localhost/api/order/558efc15fe604829b4d0607df75187e0/line-items",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
  }
}
```

## Create an order

You can manually create test orders in the admin panel to record orders made outside Shopware or send customer invoices. However, no payments, invoices, etc., are created automatically.

You can create orders for existing or new customers.

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "http://localhost/api/order",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
  },
  "body": {
    "billingAddressId": "c90e05c82c5a4457844cba7403c7ef96",
    "currencyId": "b7d2554b0ce847cd82f3ac9bd1c0dfca",
    "languageId": "2fbb5fe2e29a4d70aa5854ce7ce3e20b",
    "salesChannelId": "98432def39fc4624b33213a56b8c944d",
    "orderDateTime": "2021-05-31T14:13:14.866+00:00",
    "currencyFactor": 1.0,
    "stateId": "a75eb89b4abe41f9bade83b2f07d874e"
  }
}
```

```json json_schema
{
  "type": "object",
  "description": "Parameters for order creation.",
  "properties": {
    "billingAddressId": {
      "description": "ID of the billing address.",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "currencyId": {
      "description": "ID of the currency to which the price belongs.",
      "type": "string"
    },

      "type": "string"
    },
    "salesChannelId": {
      "description": "Unique ID of the defined sales channel.",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "orderDateTime": {
      "description": "Timestamp of the order placed.",
      "type": "string"
    },

      "type": "string"
    }
  }
}
```

Orders created are associated with payment and delivery transitions. The following section provides you with more details.

## Order state handling

Every order in Shopware has three states `order.state`, `order_delivery.state`, and `order_transaction.state`. For each state, there is a state machine that holds the status of the order, delivery, and payment status, respectively. The `state_machine_transition` is a collection of all defined transitions.

The `transition` method handles the order transition from one state to another.

### Order

On creating a new order, the order state is set to *open* by default. Order state can be transitioned among `cancel`, `complete`, `reopen`, and `process`.

Below is a sample request to change the state of order to *complete*:

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "http://localhost/api/_action/order/558efc15fe604829b4d0607df75187e0/state/complete",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
  },
  "body": {
  }
}
```

<!-- theme: info -->
> A *cancelled* order cannot change to an *in-progress* state unless it is reopened again. For more details see [order state management](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/concepts/commerce/checkout-concept/orders#state-management)

### Order delivery

The order delivery state represents the state of the delivery. `reopen`, `ship`, `ship_partially`, `cancel`, `retour`, and `retour_partially` are the states associated with order delivery.

Below is a sample request that sets the delivery state to *fail*:

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "http://localhost/api/_action/order_delivery/558efc15fe604829b4d0607df75187e0/state/fail",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
  }
}
```

### Order transaction

The order transaction state represents the state of the payment. `open`, `fail`, `authorize`, `refund_partially`, `refund`, `do_pay`, `paid`, `paid_partially`, `remind`,  and `cancel` are the states associated with order transaction.

Below is a sample request that sets the payment state to *open*:

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "http://localhost/api/_action/order_transaction/558efc15fe604829b4d0607df75187e0/state/open",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
  }
  }
```  

### Order Return

The order return management is only supported in Administration.

#### Create order return

You can initiate an order return from the Administration section by utilizing the Proxy-api. The outcome will yield a fresh order return with the `created_by_id` set to the ID of the currently logged-in user.

Below is a sample request to create new order return.

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "http://localhost/api/_proxy/order/{orderId}/return",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
  },
  "body": {
    "lineItems": [
      {
        "orderLineItemId": "c90e05c82c5a4457844cba7403c7ef96",
        "quantity": 2,
        "internalComment": "Line item comment"
      }
    ],
    "internalComment": "Order return comment"
  }
}
```

```description json_schema
{
  "type": "object",
  "description": "Parameters for adding return line items.",
  "properties": {
    "lineItems": []
    {
      "orderLineItemId": {
        "description": "ID of order line item.",
        "type": "string"
      },
      "quantity": {
        "description": "Quantity of order line item which should be returned.",
        "type": "integer"
      },
      "internalComment": {
        "description": "The optional comment when adding line item as return item",
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "internalComment": {
      "description": "The optional comment when adding line item as return item",
      "type": "string"
    }
  }
}
```

####  Add new order return line items

If you already have an existing order return, it is indeed possible to include a new item in your return. In the event that the item has already been returned previously, the returned quantity will be increased by the quantity specified in the new return.

Below is a sample request to add the new item to your return.

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "http://localhost/api/_action/order/{orderId}/order-return/{orderReturnId}/add-items",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
  },
  "body": {
    "orderLineItems": [
      {
        "orderLineItemId": "c90e05c82c5a4457844cba7403c7ef96",
        "quantity": 2,
        "internalComment": "New comment"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

```description json_schema
{
  "type": "object",
  "description": "Parameters for adding return line items.",
  "properties": {
    "orderLineItems": []
    {
      "orderLineItemId": {
        "description": "ID of order line item.",
        "type": "string"
      },
      "quantity": {
        "description": "Quantity of order line item which should be returned.",
        "type": "integer"
      },
      "internalComment": {
        "description": "The optional comment when adding line item as return item",
        "type": "string"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Order return state transition

The order return state represents `open`, `cancelled`, `in_progress`, and `done` as transaction states for order items return.

Below is a sample request that sets the orders return to *open*:

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "http://localhost/api/_action/order_return/558efc15fe604829b4d0607df75187e0/state/open",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
  }
  }
```

#### Order return line item state transition

The order return line item state represents `open`, `shipped`, `shipped_partially`, `return_requested`, `returned`, `returned_partially`, and `cancelled` as transaction states for order line items return.

Below is a sample request that sets the order return line item to `open` :

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "http://localhost/api/_action/order-line-item/state/open",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
  },
  "body": {
    "ids": ["558efc15fe604829b4d0607df75187e0"]
  }
}
```

```json json_schema
{
  "type": "object",
  "description": "Parameters for transitioning order return line item state.",
  "properties": {
    "ids": {
      "description": "ID of order line item.",
      "type": "array"
    }
  }
}
```

####  Order return calculator

The purpose of the order return calculator is to determine the total amount of the order return.

Below is a sample request that calculates the amount of provided order return's ID.

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "http://localhost/api/_action/order/return/558efc15fe604829b4d0607df75187e0/calculate",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
  }
}
```

#### Obtain customer turnover

This function is designed to retrieve the turnover figure for a specific customer. The turnover value is calculated as the total order amount minus the total return amount.

Below is a sample request to get the turnover of a customer:

```json http
{
  "method": "GET",
  "url": "http://localhost/api/_action/customer/558efc15fe604829b4d0607df75187e0/turnover",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
  }
}
```

## Refund Payment

Initiating and capturing payment is handled by [Store API](https://shopware.stoplight.io/docs/store-api/8218801e50fe5-handling-the-payment), whereas the admin API deals with refund payment.

The refund payment method can be called only for transactions that are claimed to be successful.

Generally, refunds are linked to a specific order transaction capture ID. An order can have one or more line items and amounts. Each of these line items signifies refund positions. Based on the number of line items requested for refund, the payment can either be partially or completely refunded.

<!-- theme: danger -->
> **Refund handling internals**
>
> To allow easy refund handling, have your payment handler implement the `RefundPaymentHandlerInterface`. Your refund handler implementation will be called with the `refundId` to call the PSP or gateway.
>
> For more information, check our documentation on [implementing payment refund handlers](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/plugins/checkout/payment/add-payment-plugin#refund-example)

When you refund a payment, the API will change the refund state to *complete*. If you want to fail the refund in your RefundHandler implementation, simply throw a `RefundException`, and the state of the refund will transition to *fail*.

> Your payment extensions must write their own captures and refunds into the order_transaction_capture and order_transaction_capture_refund tables, respectively, before calling the refund handler, as the Shopware Core does not carry this out.
